# Design Document - Task Scheduling System

## 1. System Architecture

### 1.1 Main Components
- **Frontend (React)**
  - User interface for task management
  - Communication with backend via REST API
  - State managed locally with React hooks

- **Backend (Node.js/Express)**
  - RESTful API for CRUD operations
  - Task scheduling service
  - Data persistence with SQLite

### 1.2 Communication
- REST API over HTTP
- JSON format for data exchange
- Main endpoints:
  - `GET /api/tasks` - List all tasks
  - `POST /api/tasks` - Create new task
  - `PUT /api/tasks/:id` - Update task
  - `DELETE /api/tasks/:id` - Remove task

## 2. Design Decisions

### 2.1 Chosen Technologies
- **SQLite**: Chosen for simplicity and single-file nature
  - Pros: Easy backup, zero configuration
  - Cons: Concurrency limitations

- **Node.js/Express**: 
  - Pros: Rich ecosystem, easy development
  - Cons: Single-threaded (mitigated with worker threads)

### 2.2 Design Patterns
- Repository Pattern for data access
- Service Layer for business logic
- Controller Layer for API endpoints

## 3. Scalability

### 3.1 Potential Bottlenecks
1. **SQLite**: 
   - Limit at ~10k simultaneous connections
   - Solution: Migrate to PostgreSQL/MySQL

2. **Task Processing**:
   - Node.js single-thread
   - Solution: Implement queue system (Redis/RabbitMQ)

### 3.2 Scaling Strategy
1. **Horizontal (short term)**:
   - Load balancer with multiple instances
   - Stateless sessions
   - Distributed cache

2. **Vertical (medium term)**:
   - Migration to robust relational database
   - Message queue implementation
   - Microservices for critical components

## 4. High Availability
- Multiple instances behind load balancer
- Health checks for auto-recovery
- Automated database backup
- Monitoring and alerts

## 5. Security
- Input validation
- Rate limiting
- CORS configured
- Data sanitization

## 6. Monitoring
- Structured logging
- Performance metrics
- Automated alerts
- Status dashboard

## 7. Technical Roadmap
1. Phase 1 (Current):
   - SQLite for persistence
   - Node.js monolith
   - Vertical scaling

2. Phase 2:
   - PostgreSQL migration
   - Queue system
   - Distributed cache

3. Phase 3:
   - Microservices
   - Kubernetes
   - Advanced observability

## 8. Scalability Strategy

### 8.1 Scaling Behavior
- **Current Scale (MVP)**
  - Single instance deployment
  - SQLite database
  - Up to 100 concurrent tasks

- **Scaling Up**
  1. **Database Migration**
     - From: SQLite (current)
     - To: PostgreSQL cluster
     - Why: Better concurrency, replication support

  2. **Load Distribution**
     - From: Single server
     - To: Multiple instances with load balancer
     - Why: Handle increased traffic, redundancy

  3. **Task Processing**
     - From: Direct execution
     - To: Message queue system
     - Why: Better task distribution, reliability

### 8.2 Scale Thresholds
- **Small Scale** (Current)
  - 0-100 concurrent tasks
  - Single server
  - Response time < 100ms

- **Medium Scale**
  - 100-1000 concurrent tasks
  - Multiple servers
  - Load balanced
  - Response time < 200ms

- **Large Scale**
  - 1000+ concurrent tasks
  - Distributed system
  - Message queues
  - Response time < 500ms

### 8.3 Resource Management
- **CPU Usage**
  - Scale up at 70% usage
  - Scale down at 30% usage

- **Memory**
  - Scale up at 80% usage
  - Scale down at 40% usage

- **Database Connections**
  - Current limit: 100
  - Future limit: 10,000 (with PostgreSQL)
